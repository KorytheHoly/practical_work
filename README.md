# Practical work in AI 
Welcome to the repository for my practical work in artificial intelligence (AI) by Jan Korytar.
## Overview 
In this repository, you will find the code and documentation for my thesis project, which focuses on using machine learning techniques in AI. The specific problem or task will be described in further detail in the documentation.
## Repository Structure
The project is organized as follows::
* **python code:** This directory contains the building blocks of code that were used in the jupyter notebooks. 
* **Jupyter notebooks:** These notebooks demonstrate how the code was used in the actual thesis project, providing examples and explanations of the techniques employed.
